Hello! I am Wen Hao, a self-taught data science enthusiast. This page contains a broad range of works that I have completed for learning and showcasing purposes, spanning from data science projects that aim to address business problems through analysis and predictive modelling, to creating simple applications that makes use of machine learning tools for fun.

	</p>
**Predicting Survey Nonresponse** - Designed and deployed a machine learning model achieving up to 80% accuracy in predicting nonresponse propensities for upcoming surveys. These predictions guided fieldwork interventions to enhance survey response rates.
<br>**Predicting Optimal Contact Time** - Augmented the nonresponse model to identify optimal contact timings for respondents, enabling fieldwork teams to plan interactions more efficiently.
<br>**Natural Language Processing Model Enhancement** - Improved an in-house text classification model by adjusting outputs, streamlining deployment processes, and updating classification labels to align with the latest government standards.
<br>**In-house Data Management Software Enhancement** - Debugged poorly implemented features and streamlining processes in an in-house data management software, reducing runtimes by almost 90% on average.

	</p>
**Predicting Survey Nonresponse** - Designed and deployed a machine learning model achieving up to 80% accuracy in predicting nonresponse propensities for upcoming surveys. These predictions guided fieldwork interventions to enhance survey response rates.
<br>**Predicting Optimal Contact Time** - Augmented the nonresponse model to identify optimal contact timings for respondents, enabling fieldwork teams to plan interactions more efficiently.
<br>**Natural Language Processing Model Enhancement** - - Improved an in-house text classification model by adjusting outputs, streamlining deployment processes, and updating classification labels to align with the latest government standards achieving a model precision of 85%.
<br>**In-house Data Management Software Enhancement** - Debugged poorly implemented features and streamlining processes of an in-house data management software, reducing runtimes by almost 90% on average.
